# Target and Probe Details
#    TargetID: The identifier entered in the Targets list.
#    Interval: The genomic interval of the target.
#    Regions: The number of regions within this target.
#    Size: The total size (in base pairs) of the regions.
#    Database(s): The databases in which this target was found.
#    Coverage: The percentage of bases overlapped by probes extended by +/- 100 base pairs to represent likely capture.
#    HighCoverage: Number of regions with overlap >= 90%.
#    LowCoverage: Number of regions with overlap < 90%.
